When hunting for fish, a kingfisher will perch on a branch or hover over the water, then dive into the water with incredible speed and accuracy. The moment of entry is so swift and precise that the bird creates very little disturbance in the water, increasing its chances of catching fish. Kingfishers have specialized, sharp bills adapted for gripping fish, and their excellent underwater vision aids in locating prey. This remarkable hunting technique makes kingfishers one of the most efficient and fascinating bird species."
